(OLC CodeJam 2024 entry)

There is an extra 5 seconds of delay when loading, to help with issues loading I haven't resolved yet.

Controls are wasd and arrow keys, jumping is also space.

1 - fps display

2 - physics debug layer

Touch the green flag to start a timer.

Touch the red flag to see your time.


Try again, no need to reload. This is an open world race... lol.

Troubleshooting notes:

If you have unusually low fps, try disconnecting any gamepad, especially if it's a ps5 with remote play. For reasons. Leave a comment if this actually happened to you. No, I don't even use gamepads, it's just something with the engine...
